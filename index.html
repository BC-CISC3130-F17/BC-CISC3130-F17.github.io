        <h3>Bulletin Description</h3>
       Stacks and their implementations. Prefix, postfix, and infix notation. Queues and linked
lists and their implementations. Binary and general trees and their implementations and
traversals. Sorting and searching techniques. Graph algorithms.

        <h3>Prerequisites and Corequisites</h3>
        I expect you to have successfully completed CISC 3110 and thus
        be fairly knowledgeable about programming in C/C++, including
        fundamentals of object-oriented programming. I strongly
        recommend that you take CISC 3120 (Design & Implementation of Software Applications I) while you
        are taking this course, so you can move directly into CISC 3140, next semester.

        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>

        If you successfully complete this course, you will

        <ul>
            <li>become competent in programming in Java</li>

            <li>deepen your understanding of object-oriented
                programming</li>

            <li>acquire experience programming with others</li>

            <li>acquire basic knowledge about programming in
                specific domains such as networking and graphics</li>
        </ul>

        In support of these objectives, your grade in the class will depend
        on how well you

<ul>
<li><p>Are an effective team member. Successful software development
requires many kinds of collaboration; therefore, this course will
allow you develop the skills you need to be a good collaborator. To
that end, we will use a unique learning
method, <a href="tbl.html">Team-Based Learning</a> (TBL), this
semester. Part of your grade will be determined by your teammates, who
will provide feedback on your collaboration skills and evaluate your
performance, based on criteria we establish at the beginning of the
semester, at two points during the semester (fifth week and final
week).</p></li>

<li> <p>Demonstrate your individual mastery of the content through
    weekly individual assessments, homework assignments, a midterm, and a final exam. In particular, you will complete individual assessments, roughly ten times throughout the semester, in which you will demonstrate your readiness to engage the week's material. This will be in the form of an individual Readiness Assurance Test (iRAT), a programming assignment, or other work you will turn in to me at the beginning of class. These assessments have three purposes: 1) to serve as your attendance record, 2) to help you clarify your responses to and questions about the topic of the day, and 3) to let you demonstrate that you have completed the readings and mastered the material.</p> </li>

<li><p>Work within a team to clarify your understanding of the content through tRATs and in-class application activities. You will work with your team to complete team Readiness Assurance Tests (tRATs). If you miss one, you will receive your team's score. You will also work with your team to complete in-class assignments (called "application activities"), which will allow teams to earn additional points</p></li>

</ul>

In addition, I expect you to

<ul>
  <li>Ask questions in class, or come see me in office
    hours, if you are confused.</li>

  <li>Let me know if, for any reason, you're having
    trouble meeting these expectations&mdash;don't vanish!</li>
</ul>

 In return, you can expect me to:

<ul>
  <li>Come to class with energy and enthusiasm.</li>

            <li>Work to make the course material as comprehensible
              as possible, and to reveal its inherent interest.</li>

  <li>Return graded homework assignments and exams as
    soon as possible.</li>

  <li>Hold you to high academic standards.</li>

  <li>Be sensitive to external demands that may affect
    your participation and performance.</li>
</ul>


        <h3>Schedule and Course Material</h3>
    <p>
      The main (required) textbook is the open textbook at <a href="http://opendatastructures.org/">http://opendatastructures.org/</a>. We will be using the C++ edition. Feel free to read it in HTML, PDF, or purchase a hardcopy. Note that the author treats the book like an open-source project, so anyone can contribute changes or corrections. You will get extra credit if you contribute a change that is accepted. See the git repository at <a href="https://github.com/patmorin/ods">https://github.com/patmorin/ods</a>.
    <p>
    <p>In addition, we will be using a supplementary C++ textbook, also freely available online, called <a href="https://fbb-git.github.io/cppannotations/">C++ Annotations</a> (you can link directly to the main text <a href="https://fbb-git.github.io/cppannotations/cppannotations/html/index.html">here</a>. This covers some "basic" C++ concepts as well as some of the more advanced concepts we'll need.
    </p>
    <p>To help with the study of data structures, we will occasionally use tools from <a href="https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/home/">OpenDSA</a>; feel free to explore that site on your own.</p>
    <p>Finally, <a href="http://cplusplus.com">http://cplusplus.com</a> is a valuable reference resource--especially the page about the <a href="http://cplusplus.com/stl">STL</a>. I may not assign readings directly from here, but I'll expect you to use it as necessary.
    </p>

<p>I will be occasionally be posting
            additional required readings, videos, etc, on the <a
                href="calendar.html">course calendar</a>, which tells
            you about the topics we'll be discussing, and the reading
            you need to do in advance of, each day. I'll also post links
            to the required readings, as well as supplemental texts, on
            the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.
        </p>
        <h3>Grading Policies</h3>

      <p>The grading policies determined by each section on the first day of the course are posted <a href="grades.html">here</a>.</p>

      <p>
        Because this is a fast-paced, demanding course, I will generally not
        allow late submission of assignments. If you have a medical/family emergency that causes you to miss class, talk to me about it ASAP. If you find that
        events in your life are making it difficult for you to
        complete work for this class in timely fashion, please talk
        to me <em>as soon as possible</em> so that we can discuss
        how to get you through the class.
      </p>

      <p>I will determine your final grade with a rough "curve."
        Almost always, I set the lowest "B-" grade to be the
        average <em>for your section</em>.. So if you are above the average for your section, you will earn a B
        or A; if you are below the average you will earn a C or
        lower. You can use this is a rough guide to translate your
        scores on exams and assignments into letter grades. Note that anyone who earns less than 50% of the available points (weighted according to the class policy) for <em>individual work</em> (see the grading policies page; this includes midterm, final, and programming assignments) will get an F in the class regardless of their overall score. Anyone who earns less thatn 50% of the available points for <em>individual work</em> (see the grading policies page; this includes midterm, final, and programming assignments) will get an F in the class regardless of their overall score.</p>

      <p>I will use the webapp <a href="http://www.gradesly.com">Gradesly</a> to provide you a fairly current report on your grades and your standing in the course. Please be aware that your <em>final</em> standing in the course may differ from what is reported in Gradesly, because the final curve is applied only to <em>students who take the final</em>. In particular, your final grade could be somewhat lower than you expect.</p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>

       <p> Coming to my office hours is the best way to get my undivided
        attention. I strongly encourage you to visit me in office hours
        at least once; in fact, I will give you 1% of your course grade
        <strong>extra credit</strong> if you come to my office hours
        before the midterm with a question related to the course or the
        CIS majors. When you can't make it to office hours to ask a
        question, then email is far more effective than the telephone.
        If you call my office during office hours, I will answer if I'm
        not with another student; at other times, I may not answer. The
        college's voicemail system is clunky and time-consuming; if you
        leave me a voicemail, I will probably never listen to it. Email
        me instead. Make sure the subject of your email begins with <b>CISC
            3130</b> to make sure I give it quick attention. If you email me
        after 9pm or over the weekend, I may not respond until 9am the
        next weekday morning.</p>

          <p>I will often email the entire class with hints, updates, or supplemental material. I will most often use the email address you have registered with the BC Portal (portal.brooklyn.cuny.edu), so please double-check that is up-to-date. Occasionally, I will need to communicate with you via CUNYfirst, so please ensure that also has a current email address for you (in the <em>Self Service</em>-><em>Personal Information</em> menu).</p>

        <h3>Values, Ethics, and Accountability</h3>

        <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>

        <p>
            The faculty and administration of Brooklyn College and the
            City University of New York support an environment free from
            cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for
            being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and
            for avoiding both. The complete text of the CUNY Academic
            Integrity Policy and the Brooklyn College procedure for
            implementing that policy can be found here:</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/la/Academic_Integrity_Policy.pdf ">http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/la/Academic_Integrity_Policy.pdf</a>.</p>

            <p>According to this policy, "A faculty member who suspects
            that a student has committed a violation of the CUNY
            Academic Integrity Policy shall review with the student the
            facts and circumstances of the suspected violation whenever
            feasible. Thereafter, a faculty member who concludes there
            has been an incident of academic dishonesty sufficient to
            affect the student's final course grade shall report such
            incidents...."
        </p>

        <p>I take this policy very seriously. Among the actions
            which may constitute a policy violation in this course:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copying from another student during an examination
                or allowing another to copy your work;</li>
            <li>Unauthorized collaboration on a take home
                assignment or examination;</li>
            <li>Using notes during a closed book examination;</li>
            <li>Allowing others to do assigned projects, including
                use of commercial services;</li>
            <li>Copying another person's code without attributing
                the source.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are responsible for understanding the entirety of
            CUNY's policy; if you have questions, don't hesitate to ask
            me.</p>
        <p>
            In particular, if I determine that part or all of one coding
            assignment has been copied from another, <em>all</em>
            students involved will get a <b>zero</b> on the assignment.
            You are responsible for safeguarding your work.
        </p>

         <p>In general, I will encourage collaboration during class, but I also expect you to be able to work effectively on your own. You are responsible for understanding the entirety of
        CUNY's policy; if you have questions, don't hesitate to ask
        me.</p>

        <h4>Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility</h4>

           <p>I believe that the diversity of Brooklyn College classrooms is one of the most important characteristics of a Brooklyn College education. I am  committed to creating an inclusive classroom that respects a wide range of experiences, viewpoints, and abilities.</p>

<p>If you  have a documented disability, or suspect you  may have a
disability, I encourage you to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, Ms. Valerie Stewart-Lovell, at 718.951.5538.  If you have already
registered with the Center for Student Disability Services,
please provide me with the course accommodation form and
discuss your specific accommodation with me. I will be more
than happy to help.</p>

        <h4>Career Services</h4>
        <p>Most computer science courses, certainly including this one, are about enhancing your abilities and providing skills you will need to be a successful professional. In addition to your coursework, I strongly recommend you engage with the College's excellent career center. It's never
      too early to start preparing for your career; if you're
      interested in preparing a resume, finding a job or
      internship, connecting your college experience with a career
      or developing professional skills, visit the Magner Career
      Center at: 1303 James Hall, call 718-951-5696 or sign up for
      workshops and jobs and internship notifications on the
      WebCentral Portal (http://portal.brooklyn.cuny.edu).</p>
